# 🎮 2048 Mini Game (Vanilla JS)

A minimal clone of the classic [2048 game](https://play2048.co), built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no libraries.

This project includes:
- A 4x4 grid with soft pink background
- Rounded square cells
- Two "2" tiles placed randomly on load
- Arrow key controls (← ↑ → ↓) for merging and sliding numbers
- All built from scratch using your own game logic and `while` loops
